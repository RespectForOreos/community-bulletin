This repository contains the code for a commnity bulletin web applicaton. This web application was built with 
Flask and is limited to local hosting as of December 23rd, 2023. A dashboard displays current events that are
able to be clicked on to go to their respective event pages with information, which is all stored in the events
database. HTML credits go to Damon Huynh, my junior web developer. Future looks of this project that will be branches
will be user logins as well as user pages to see which events they have posted, modifying the database to store 
dates and times in the form of DateTime to be able to delete events when their dates have passed. A search bar 
might be implemented in due time, but that is the farthest branch that would be pushed to main. I hope this project
goes well. I've been able to learn a lot about web development with Python by building this project.
